<h1>Using Ruby 1.9.2 with Engine Yard AppCloud</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ruby 1.9.2 is currently in Beta support on Engine Yard AppCloud. This version of MRI brings substantial performance improvements, and is a great way to get started with the 1.9 series.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Each environment is associated with a specific version of the runtime that will be used to run all applications contained in that environment.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>Support for users of Ruby 1.9.2 is provided via the dedicated <a href="http://docs.engineyard.com/beta/signup-ruby-192">Ruby 1.9.2 forum</a>. All AppCloud customers can access support for Ruby 1.9.2 via this forum until it is promoted from the <a href="http://docs.engineyard.com/beta/home">Engine Yard Beta Program</a>.</p>

<h3>New Environment</h3>

<ul><li>Create a new environment using the <strong>Create New Environment</strong> link on the dashboard.</li>
<li>On the new environment page, click on <strong>Show Advanced Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Ruby Runtime section, pick <strong>Ruby 1.9.2 (beta)</strong>. You will also need to pick the latest Experimental Stack to use MRI 1.9.2.</li>

<li>If you have existing applications running in the environment, the dashboard will prompt you to rebuild the environment, which will re-run chef recipes and update the runtime to use Ruby 1.9.2.</li>
