<p>While that opens in a new window you can continue to follow along here.</p>

<h2>Create an Engine Yard SSO</h2>

<p>By creating an Engine Yard Single Sign-On account you'll be able to access all our applications on the internet with one set of credentials.</p>

<p>{{ :appcloud:guides:account_verified.jpg|Figure 1}}</p>

<p>On the sign up page you need to fill out the following:</p>

<ul><li>Email</li>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Company</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Password Confirmation</li>
</ul><p>Then the usual song and dance of a verification email is sent to your account.  It's fast, just open your mail client and click on the link to verify your account.</p>

<p>Once you click on the verification link you get authorized and  see a good green message like Figure 1 to the right.  You're ready.</p>

<p>Of the three links you see there, the most applicable to this guide is the first link:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Engine Yard AppCloud - on Amazon EC2</strong></li>
</ul><p>Click on that link to continue.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Support Plan</h2>

<p>{{ :appcloud:guides:successfull_billing_info.jpg|Figure 3}}</p>

<p>Rather than instruct you how to fill out another form, you can just know that once you're credit card information is validated, you're ready to go!</p>

<p>Later, once you're in the system, if you need to change the credit card information for any reason you'll be able to.</p>

<p>So if you're a developer and want to get started and have "the money" come in later and put their card on file later, you can do that.</p>
