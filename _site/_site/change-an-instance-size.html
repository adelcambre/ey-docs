			<h1>Change an Instance Size</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Currently, it's only possible to change the size of instances by terminating your environment and spinning up new instances at the size you want. The only exception to this is with utility instances, where you can choose the size at the time it's added to your cluster. Fortunately, snapshots are taken when you terminate your environment and you can restore onto your new instances from these snapshots.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that your existing instance configuration is <em>not stored after you terminate</em>. When you spin up new instances, the IP you had previously used will be used again by default, but the size and number of instances you used along with any utility instance names will not be saved, so you'll want to take note of what those settings are prior to terminating your environment.</p>

<h2>Snapshots</h2>

<p>Snapshot timestamps will show up in UTC when creating new instances, so the easiest way to find the snapshot you want is to take note of how far past the current hour it was when you terminated and then look for the most recent snapshot matching that. Unless you made changes when you created your environment, it will have defaulted to taking a snapshot once per day. As such, depending on the amount of data you have and how much changed since the last snapshot, the snapshotting process can take a while.</p>

<p>If your instance volumes are fairly small (e.g., less than 30GB), then the snapshotting process will likely only take a couple of minutes or less because only the data that changed from one snapshot to another has to be backed up. If you have a lot of data and/or a lot of data changed since the last backup, then it might take 30 minutes or more (though, that generally is only if you have a LOT of data). Just some things to keep in mind when scheduling this.</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<p>Since resizing your instances will require terminating the whole environment, it's a good idea to also consider resizing your volume sizes during this process as well. The default volume size of 5GB is a good start, but at a cost of $0.10 per GB per month, it's cheap to switch to a larger volume size and give yourself room to grow later. A good amount to go with generally is 15GB for your application instances and maybe 30GB for your database master. It's best to give yourself a lot of growing room since it requires full termination to increase your volume size.</p>

<h2>Resizing</h2>

<p>To resize your instances properly, take the following steps.</p>

<ul><li>Make a note of the current instance sizes being used, their volume sizes, and any utility instance names you're using.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Terminate</strong> button for the environment you want to change. This is when you would want to change your application stack if you're going to do so.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Boot Instances</strong> button for the environment you terminated and now want to restart.</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>Custom</strong> option.</li>
<li>Choose the number of application instances you want, set the new size you'd like and then choose the snapshot you want to restore from.</li>
<li>Check <strong>Use separate database instance</strong> (this will already be checked if you chose more than one application server). Choose the size you want for your database instance (add the number of slaves you want or had setup previously) and choose the snapshot you want to restore from.</li>
<li>Scroll down a bit and setup your Utility Instances (if you had any) choosing the new instance size and snapshot you want to use.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Boot this Configuration</strong> button at the bottom of the page once you're finished.</li>
</ul><p>In some cases, you may run into problems where Amazon has run out of capacity for the instance size you're using (this happens most frequently with Small instances or the extremely large ones). If this happens it would show up on your main dashboard as an instance's status turning red and "Amazon is currently out of capacity" will show as the error. If you get that error, <a href="amazon-out-of-capacity">read here</a> to fix the problem.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, this process is fairly painless aside from how long it can take sometimes. It's highly recommended that you plan to perform this upgrade at a non-peak hour and give yourself plenty of time to sort out any potential issues you may run into.</p>
