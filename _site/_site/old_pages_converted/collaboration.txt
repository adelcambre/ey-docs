====== Collaboration ======

{{ :beta:collaboration.jpeg|}} 

Have you always wanted to be able to share your account (or one of your accounts) with other developers? Or as a developer, you wish you only needed one login account to access different projects?

Now you can, with Collaboration for Engine Yard AppCloud.

Steps to getting started:

  - [[signup-collaboration|Request Access]]
  - [[appcloud:guides/environments/collaboration|Getting Started with Collaboration]]

Note, only the account owner needs to request the Collaboration feature. They can share their account with other users who haven't requested access to the Collaboration feature.

Those other developers (Engine Yard AppCloud users) can request to join the Collaboration Beta mailing list too.
