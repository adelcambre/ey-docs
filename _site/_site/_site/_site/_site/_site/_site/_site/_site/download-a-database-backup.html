<h1>Download a Database Backup</h1>

<p>If you have downloaded a database backup via the <a href="http://cloud-support.engineyard.com/faqs/database/how-to-manage-database-backups">ey-backup gem</a> to your running instance, you can then use <code>scp</code> to transfer the backup file to your local computer.</p>

<pre><code>scp username@IP_address:/path_to_file destination
</code></pre>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This assumes that either:</p>

<ul><li>You are on a *NIX system, such as Linux or OS X, or</li>
<li>You are on Windows and are using Cygwin</li>
</ul><p>You'll need:</p>

<ul><li>Your username on the instance</li>
<li>The IP Address assigned to the instance</li>
<li>The path to the file on the server</li>
</ul><h2>Putting it All Together</h2>

<p>Where <code>username</code> equals the "User account name" you've configured in your environment, and the <code>IP_address</code> is one you've generated for the instance currently running.</p>

<p>The common practice for the destination is to change to the directory on your local computer where you want to receive the file.  For example:  <code>cd ~/database_backups</code>.</p>

<pre><code>scp cloud_user@123.123.123.123:/path/to/the/db_backup_file .
</code></pre>

<p>This will use the <code>scp</code> protocol to have the <code>cloud_user@123.123.123.123</code> transfer the <code>/path/to/the/db_backup_file</code> to the current working directory on your local machine <code>.</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> don't forget the colon ":" between the IP address and the /path/to/the/db_backup_file.</p>
