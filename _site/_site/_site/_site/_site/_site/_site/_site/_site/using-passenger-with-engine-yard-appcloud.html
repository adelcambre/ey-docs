<h1>Using Passenger 3 with Engine Yard AppCloud</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Phusion Passenger 3 is currently in Beta support on Engine Yard AppCloud. This version of Passenger brings substantial performance improvements. As a major version release, we decided to release it as an Alpha feature for opt-in customers.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Each environment can choose to change from “Passenger” to “Passenger 3” independently. All applications on that environment will use the Passenger 3 web server.</p>

<p>See below for <strong>Getting Started</strong> instructions for New Environments or updating Existing Environments.</p>
