<ul><li> First you will need to create a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account.</li>
<li> Once you are logged in you will want to create a new repository.</li>

<ul><li> Once you follow those directions you will have your applications code up and stored on GitHub. Whenever you make any local changes in your git repo and want to have it stored in your GitHub repo all you have to do is type <code>git push</code> while in the local repo and it will push your newly committed code to GitHub.</li>
