<h1>How to Migrate your Application</h1>

<h2>This is an initial template you can use for your migration steps</h2>

<h3>Migrations Steps Template</h3>

<ul><li>Put up your maintenance page on your current environment</li>
<li>Stop the application</li>
<li>Stop all background jobs, cron jobs, etc that update data</li>
<li>Ensure that there are no longer any connections to the database</li>
<li>Dump and compress the database</li>
<li><code>scp</code> it to your AppCloud database instance</li>
<li><code>rsync</code> any assets over to your new EY AppCloud instance(s)</li>
<li>Load your the DB dump into the database</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong> the new setup on EY AppCloud (this is the final step before sending your users over to the new setup)</li>
<li>Update DNS to point to your EY AppCloud IP</li>
<li>Update your nginx config to redirect any traffic hitting your old IP to the new IP</li>
<li>Congrats you're done!</li>
</ul><div></div>

<p>Before you start your migration, we recommend that you walk through the above steps, modify them as needed for your particular environment and add/remove steps as needed.  For a running production environment, you can just document and simulate steps 1-4 and 10-11 and walk through the remaining steps.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Listing out or scripting any commands needed for each step can save time and prevent human errors.</p>
