<h1>Boot Instances</h1>

<p>Here you need to decide how you want to architect your environment. There are three main choices:</p>

<ul><li>Single Server - Use this for test applications that do not require significant load, or for staging/development environments. These use a HighCPU Medium.</li>
<li>Basic Cluster - This is the basic recommendation for production applications. It offers high availability, a dedicated database, and horizontal scalability.</li>
<li>Customer - Here you can create your own cluster configuration. This allows you to choose different instance sizes, set up Utility instances, and slave databases.</li>
</ul><p>This will also give you the IP Address for your environment. If you have any non-allocated IP addresses, you can choose one in the drop-down menu or Amazon will provision a new one for you.</p>

<p>Moving from a single instance to a cluster can be done, but it requires some downtime. Follow <a href="">these instructions</a> to learn how to make this move.</p>
