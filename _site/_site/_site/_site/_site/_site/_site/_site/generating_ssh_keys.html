<h1>Generating SSH Keys</h1>

<p>In order to SSH into an Engine Yard AppCloud slice, you'll need to create an SSH keypair.</p>

<p>We use this to authenticate you on the system, it has the additional benefit of logging you in without a password.</p>

<p>The command you run from a *nix based command line terminal is this:</p>

<p>  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa</p>

<p>The output will come back like this:</p>

<p><code>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/tbird/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/tbird/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/tbird/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
c9:26:4a:1b:7d:35:9f:c3:c2:b0:b4:5a:7c:8c:65:d9 tbird@jupiter
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|           o     |
|        o * E    |
|     . + % + .   |
|    o o S = =    |
|   . + * . . .   |
|    o .          |
|                 |
|                 |

</code></p>

<ul><li>When it prompts you where to save the key, the default path is fine.</li>
<li>Entering a passphrase is more secure.  You can use an ssh-agent so that you won't have to type your passphrase every time you connect.</li>
<li>The rest of the output will automatically be generated.</li>
</ul><p>Then two files are generated in your home directory.</p>

<p>  id_rsa
  id_rsa.pub</p>

<p>The ''id_rsa.pub'' file is the public key file that you'll use to push to Engine Yard AppCloud.</p>
