<h1>Collaboration</h1>

<p>{{ :beta:collaboration.jpeg|}}</p>

<p>Have you always wanted to be able to share your account (or one of your accounts) with other developers? Or as a developer, you wish you only needed one login account to access different projects?</p>

<p>Now you can, with Collaboration for Engine Yard AppCloud.</p>

<p>Steps to getting started:</p>

<ul><li><a href="signup-collaboration">Request Access</a></li>
<li><a>Getting Started with Collaboration</a></li>
</ul><p>Note, only the account owner needs to request the Collaboration feature. They can share their account with other users who haven't requested access to the Collaboration feature.</p>

<p>Those other developers (Engine Yard AppCloud users) can request to join the Collaboration Beta mailing list too.</p>
