<h1>IP Addresses</h1>

<p>In order to use a static IP address with Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), you need to request one via the Engine Yard AppCloud interface. You may request up to 5 IP addresses.</p>

<h2>Add an Address</h2>

<ul><li>From the Dashboard for your non-running environment, you click <strong>Boot Instances</strong>.</li>
<li>Then for the External Address drop-down you select <strong>Add IP Address</strong> and a new IP address will be allocated for you and assigned this application in this environment.</li>
</ul><h2>Detach an Address</h2>

<p>You can detach an IP address from a running instance.</p>

<ul><li>From the <strong>IP Addresses</strong> tab you'll see a list of your IP addresses.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Detach</strong> link, the confirmation box appears.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> once you're sure.</li>
</ul><h2>Attach an Address</h2>

<p>Once you detach an IP address you can move it to a different environment.  You will need to shut down the environment before attaching it.  We recommend taking a manual snapshot of your data to help speed the termination of the environment.</p>

<h3>Snapshot Your Data</h3>

<ul><li>Click on the <strong>Snapshot</strong> button for your environment.</li>
<li>Wait until the snapshot completes.</li>
</ul><h3>Boot The Instance</h3>

<p>Now you'll reboot the instance and attach the IP address you detached above.
  - Click on <strong>Boot Instances</strong> to be taken to the configuration for "your application" screen.
  - Configure your cluster for your needs.
  - For the External Address drop-down, choose the <strong>IP address</strong> you detached.</p>

<h2>Delete an Address</h2>

<p>If you're sure you won't need an IP address anymore, you can remove it from your account.</p>

<ul><li>Under <strong>Server Tools</strong> on the left, click on the <strong>IP Addresses</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Look for the IP address you want to delete.</li>
<li>Then click on the <strong>Delete</strong> link to remove the IP address.</li>
</ul>
