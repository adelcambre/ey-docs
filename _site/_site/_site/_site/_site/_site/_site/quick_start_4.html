<h1>SSH Key</h1>

<p>One great feature of AppCloud is the ability to SSH into your instance. You have root access to your instance - allowing you to configure your instance and application to your heart's content.</p>

<p>If you have existing SSH keys that you previously added, you can click the checkbox next to the key and add it to this application.</p>

<p>If you need to add a new SSH key, <a href="">generate your key</a>, give your keypair a name, and add the public key (either <em>id_rsa.pub</em> or <em>id_dsa.pub</em>) here.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> You can skip this step and add your SSH key later if you would like.</p>
