====== Convert Capistrano Symlinks to AppCloud Symlinks ======

Many people use Capistrano to configure symlinks to shared folders.  Ideally you'd be able to fully deploy your app from the Engine Yard AppCloud UI without Capistrano.

===== For Example =====

Here's an example of a common Capistrano recipes for symlinking folders:

    after "deploy:update_code", "symlink_files"
    after "deploy:update_code", "symlink_geo_ip"

    task :symlink_files do
      %w(photo card).each do |folder|
        path  = "#{release_path}/../../shared/files/#{folder}"
        symlink_path = "#{release_path}/public/#{folder}"
        run "mkdir -p #{path}"
        puts "Symlinking #{folder} folder"
        run "rm -rf #{symlink_path}"
        run "ln -sf #{path} #{symlink_path}"
      end
    end
    
    task :symlink_geo_ip do
      path  = "#{release_path}/../../shared/GeoIPCity.dat"
      symlink_path = "#{release_path}/db/GeoIPCity.dat"
      puts "Symlinking GeoIP"
      run "rm -rf #{symlink_path}"
      run "ln -sf #{path} #{symlink_path}"
    end

===== Using Deploy Hooks =====

Instead we suggest you use our new method of deploy hooks that will run the commands for you when you deploy your application using Engine Yard AppCloud's User Interface.

Create a file $RAILS_ROOT/deploy/before_symlink.rb with these contents:

    %w(photo card).each do |folder|
        run "echo 'release_path: #{release_path}/public/#{folder}' >> #{shared_path}/logs.log"
        run "ln -nfs #{shared_path}/files/#{folder} #{release_path}/public/#{folder}"
    end
    	
    run "echo 'release_path: #{release_path}/db/GeoIPCity.dat' >> #{shared_path}/logs.log"
    run "ln -nfs #{shared_path}/shared/GeoIPCity.dat #{release_path}/db/GeoIPCity.dat"
	
Please note we are using the "Release" path instead of "Current" as it hasn't been symlinked yet.

===== Conclusion =====

By converting to deploy hooks, your app can now be deployed from the Engine Yard AppCloud UI without having to use Capistrano.
