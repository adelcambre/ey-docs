<h1>Hibernate Your Account</h1>

<p>If you don't need to use your EY AppCloud account, you don't have to cancel, hibernate it instead!</p>

<h2>What is Hibernation?</h2>

<p>You Hibernate your account when you turn off all running instances, delete all environments and remove any Elastic IP addresses.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<ul><li>Go to your Dashboard.</li>
<li>Turn off your instances by clicking on the <strong>Terminate</strong> button.</li>
<li>Then <strong>Delete</strong> each Environment.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>IP Addresses</strong>, under Server Tools.</li>
</ul><p>{{:appcloud:howtos:billing:delete_all_ip_address.jpg?700|}}</p>

<ul><li>Then make sure to <strong>Delete</strong> all Elastic IP addresses.</li>
</ul><h2>Why Do I Have to Delete the IP Addresses?</h2>

<p>If an IP address is in use, Amazon will not charge you.</p>

<p>But if you "reserve" an IP, that is keep it assigned to your account but not running an instance, Amazon charges you a monthly fee for each IP address.</p>

<p>They charge $0.01 per hour.  For a 30 day month, that would be $7.20 to keep the IP address.</p>

<h2>How to Re-activate</h2>
