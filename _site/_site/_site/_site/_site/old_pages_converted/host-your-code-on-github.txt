====== Host your Code on Github =====
{{ :appcloud:rating-beginner.png|}}
Now that you have your local machine setup and have created your first Ruby on Rails application it is time for you to host your code somewhere. You have many options on where you can host your code, but the simplest is hosting it on Github. I will guide you through that process.

First you will need to create a [[https://github.com/|Github]] account.

Once you are logged in you will want to create a new repository.

Give your project a name and description and then click Create Repository.

Next you will be presented with the guide of how to connect your local git repo with your github repo.

Once you follow those directions you will have your applications code up and stored on Github. Whenever you make any local changes in your git repo and want to have it stored in your Github repo all you have to do is type ''git push'' while in the local repo and it will push your newly committed code to Github.
