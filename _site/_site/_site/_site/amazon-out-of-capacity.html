<p><strong>NOTE: Although we offer these instructions to help you quickly solve this issue manually, we are working on an automated solution.</strong></p>

<p>When you are booting up your instance sometimes you will run into this message: "Amazon is currently out of capacity".</p>

<p>{{:appcloud:howtos:amazon_capacity.jpeg?700}}</p>

<p>You will need to wait for about a minute and then you will see an <strong>Acknowledge</strong> link right next to the <strong>Custom log</strong> link appear. If you have an application master and master database running the link will appear for each of them.</p>

<p>{{:appcloud:howtos:acknowledge.jpeg?700}}</p>

<p>Once the links appear click on them until you have no running instances in your environment. Then you will want to click on the <strong>More Options</strong> tab.</p>

<p>{{:appcloud:howtos:more_options.jpeg?700}}</p>

<p>In the more options section you will see many options to choose from. For this particular case you will want to click on the <strong>Edit Environment</strong> link.</p>

<p>{{:appcloud:howtos:edit_environment.jpeg?700}}</p>

<p>You will then be presented with the <strong>Edit the Environment</strong> page that you had during the quick start process. Here you will want to click on the <strong>(show advanced options)</strong> link.</p>

<p>{{:appcloud:howtos:advanced_options.jpeg?300}}</p>

<p>Now you will be presented with a list of advanced option that includes changing the Ruby runtime and the most important for this error, the <strong>Availability Zone</strong>. Change the availability zone from what it currently is to another area. Once you have done this make sure to click the <strong>Update Instances</strong> button.</p>

<p>You will then be redirected to the dashboard. Here you will want to click on the <strong>Boot Instance</strong> button. Then choose what type of configuration you want to have and boot up again.</p>

<p>When you boot up again the error should disappear and your application and master server will be setup and ready to go.  Repeat (if at all necessary).</p>
