<p>If you are using <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>, you can skip this step. AppCloud's deployment process will use your <code>Gemfile</code> and add your gems and their dependencies.</p>

<p>If you are not using Bundler, then you can search for the gems needed for your application. Choose the correct version and then select the plus sign to add them to your application. You can also any custom gems you have here.</p>
