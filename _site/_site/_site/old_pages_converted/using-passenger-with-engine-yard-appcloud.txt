====== Using Passenger 3 with Engine Yard AppCloud ======

===== Introduction =====

Phusion Passenger 3 is currently in Beta support on Engine Yard AppCloud. This version of Passenger brings substantial performance improvements. As a major version release, we decided to release it as an Alpha feature for opt-in customers.

===== Overview =====

Each environment can choose to change from “Passenger” to “Passenger 3” independently. All applications on that environment will use the Passenger 3 web server.

See below for "Getting Started" instructions for New Environments or updating Existing Environments.
