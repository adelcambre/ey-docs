# SSH Key

One great feature of AppCloud is the ability to SSH into your instance. You have root access to your instance - allowing you to configure your instance and application to your heart's content.

If you have existing SSH keys that you previously added, you can click the checkbox next to the key and add it to this application.

If you need to add a new SSH key, [[generate your key|generating_ssh_keys]], give your keypair a name, and add the public key (either *id_rsa.pub* or *id_dsa.pub*) here.

***NOTE:*** You can skip this step and add your SSH key later if you would like.
