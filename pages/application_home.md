# Applications

This section outlines how to manage your application on EY AppCloud. If you're looking to add SSL to your application please see this article: [[SSL Certs|ssl-certificates]].

## Add an Application

You can configure many different applications and their corresponding repository URL and framework under Engine Yard AppCloud.  Then applications can be used in one or more environment.

  - Under SERVER TOOLS, click on the **Applications** section.
  - In the top right corner, click on the **Add a New Application** link.
  - Give your application a name.
  - Enter a Git Repository URI.
  - Choose an Application Type.
  - Then click the "Create application" button to begin the process.

A new screen with the git deploy key for your application will appear.

  - Copy the git deploy key.
  - Paste it to your GitHub Account.
  - Click **My Deploy Key is in Place** when ready.

Once you've setup the deploy key, you're ready to setup any other specific gems. If you are using bundler, you can skip to the Unix Packages page.

  * Search for a Gem
  * Or Add a Gem From a Custom Gem Server
  * Click **Select Unix Packages** after all Gems have been configured.

On the Unix Packages page you can configure system dependences.  For example: *imagemagick*.

  * Search for a Unix Package
  * Click **Go to dashboard** after you've configured all Unix packages.

Now all dependences for your application have been configured by Engine Yard AppCloud, we'll be able to boot our custom AMI, apply your changes, deploy your application, and breath life to it on EC2!

## Edit an Application

There is more than one way to get to the edit an application screen.

  * The **Applications** tab under SERVER TOOLS will list your applications.
  * You can then click on the name of your application to edit.
