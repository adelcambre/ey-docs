![Deploy Key]()

Deploy keys are ssh keys that allow AppCloud to pull from your repos. These are required if your deploying from a private repository.

Copy the deploy key provided in AppCloud (or click the clipboard button) and sign in to your [[GitHub|http://www.github.com]] account.

- From the homepage of your private repository click on the **Admin** button.
- Once on the Admin page, you'll see the Deploy Key's section, click **Add another deploy key**.
- Give your Deploy Key a **Title** and paste in the **Key** into the field below Title.
- Click **Add key** to save your key to the repository.

Back in the AppCloud UI, check *My deploy key is in place* and continue to next step.
