# Final Step - DEPLOY

Once your instances have booted, they are ready for you to deploy your application. 

* Click the *Applications* tab on the Dashboard.
* Check the *Migrate?* box if you have any rake tasks you would like to run after deploying. Enter these commands in the textbox.
* Choose the *ref* for your repo.
* Hit the *Deploy* button.

The UI will display if the Deployment was successful or if there was a problem. If a problem occurs, click the *View Log* to see what problem occurred. In addition, you can SSH into your instance to fix any problems.

Also check out the *Deployment history* to see a list of your deployments for this application.
You can add any additional gems or Unix packages here as well.

CONGRATS! You've deployed your application to AppCloud. Make sure you look at some of the [Features]() available so you can use AppCloud to its fullest potential.
