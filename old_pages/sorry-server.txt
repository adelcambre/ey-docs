===== Sorry Server & Sorry Pages =====

Each cluster has its own [[xcloud:glossary#sorry server|sorry server]] that serves the default Engine Yard generated [[xcloud:glossary#sorry pages|sorry pages]].

By default all [[xcloud:glossary#internet services]] on port 80 and 443 are setup to redirect to a per customer [[xcloud:glossary#redirect url|redirect url]] on the cluster local sorry server should none of the [[xcloud:glossary#slice|slices]] be responding to the [[xcloud:glossary#load balancer|load balancer's]] health checks.

==== Example ====
Your site (http://bobcoisawesome.com) is made of up 2 slices on tm22 and your company is called "bobco". Both slices are down for some sort of maintenance. Visitors to your website are redirected to http://sorry.tm22.engineyard.com/bobco, where they see the default Engine Yard sorry page.

===== Customizing Your Sorry Pages =====
We can setup custom sorry pages that appear at the established redirection url for your company. Please [[http://support.cloud.engineyard.com|file a ticket]] asking support for assistance on this matter. Make sure to include a tar.gz or zip file archive of the files you would like setup.

Each set of pages will be hosted out of a sub directory, so make sure the pages properly reference its resources. All assets, like javascript, css, images, etc should live in a subdirectory named "assets". So the structure of the files should be:
<code>
/bobco
  index.html
  /assets
    my.css
    my.js
</code>

===== Multiple Sorry Pages =====
We can add multiple sets of sorry pages, allowing you to customize the sorry pages on a per internet service basis (think per site for most use cases). Please [[http://support.cloud.engineyard.com|file a ticket]] asking support for assistance on this matter. Make sure to include a tar.gz or zip file archive of the files you would like setup and what site(s) should redirect to these new pages.

===== Customizing Your Redirection =====
If you have more complex requirements than EY is able to handle with its sorry servers we can change the redirect url for your internet service(s) to be whatever url you choose. Please [[http://support.cloud.engineyard.com|file a ticket]] asking support for assistance on this matter. Please make sure to include the redirect url.
