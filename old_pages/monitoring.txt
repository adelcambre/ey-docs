====== Monitoring a Rails App ======

Monitoring your site’s uptime is an important component to an overall strategy of keeping your site online and your visitors happy.

===== Install the FitterHappier Plugin =====

[[http://github.com/atmos/fitter_happier/tree/master|FitterHappier]] is a Rails plug-in that provides actions for monitoring site and/or database availability. FitterHappier’s monitoring controller disables unnecessary Rails features, like sessions, layouts, and logging, for lightning-fast monitoring URIs.

To install FitterHappier, run the following commands from the project root of your Rails application:

    cd vendor/plugins
    git clone git://github.com/atmos/fitter_happier.git

For assurance, fire-up your application on your development machine and test the following URIs:

    curl localhost:3000/fitter_happier
    FitterHappier Site Check Passed
    
    curl localhost:3000/fitter_happier/site_check
    FitterHappier Site Check Passed @ Wed, 17 Dec 2008 14:27:47 -0800
    
    curl localhost:3000/fitter_happier/site_and_database_check
    FitterHappier Site and Database Check Passed @ Wed, 17 Dec 2008 14:27:57 -0800
    Schema Version: 20081217141904

===== A Ticket Adds Your URL to Siteuptime =====

Once your fitter happier plugin is setup on your application and deployed, you need to [[http://support.cloud.engineyard.com|open a ticket]] and let us know that you're ready for us to monitor this URL for you.

The best one to include is the ''site_and_database_check'' URL:

    http://yoursite.com/fitter_happier/site_and_database_check
    
We will setup the URL monitor with our 3rd party provider [[http://siteuptime.com|siteuptime.com]] and reply to you via the ticket when it's complete, and you're URL is being monitored!
